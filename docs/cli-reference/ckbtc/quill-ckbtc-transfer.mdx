## Examples

The `quill ckbtc transfer` command is used to transfer ckBTC from one account to another.

For example, to transfer 0.5 ckBTC to the anonymous principal, `2vxsx-fae`:

```sh
quill ckbtc transfer 2vxsx-fae --amount 0.5
```

This will produce a response like:

```candid
(variant { Ok = 5_581_035 : nat })
```

This refers to the block index, also known as block height, at which the transaction took place; you can look up this transaction on the [IC dashboard]. 

## Remarks

Note that the returned index is the index for the ckBTC ledger, *not* an index for the Bitcoin ledger.

As this is an update call, it will not actually make the request, but rather generate a signed and packaged request that can be sent from anywhere. You can use the `--qr` flag to display it as a QR code, or if you are not working with an air-gapped machine, you can pipe it to `quill send`.
