<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Reference"]} />

Converts the maturity from a neuron into SNS utility tokens.

## Basic usage

The basic syntax for running `quill sns disburse-maturity` commands is:

```bash
quill sns disburse-maturity <NEURON_ID> [option]
```

## Arguments

| Argument      | Description                           |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| `<NEURON_ID>` | The neuron to disburse maturity from. |


## Flags

| Flag           | Description                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------|
| `-h`, `--help` | Displays usage information. |

## Options

| Option                      | Description                                          |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `--percentage <PERCENTAGE>` | The percentage of the maturity to disburse           |
| `--to <TO>`                 | The account to transfer the SNS utility tokens to    |
| `--subaccount <SUBACCOUNT>` | The subaccount to transfer the SNS utility tokens to |

## Remarks

Unlike [`quill sns disburse`], disbursing maturity can be performed on any neuron that has accrued maturity, not only dissolved neurons; however, it can only be used to disburse voting rewards, not the initial stake. To instead add maturity to the stake, see [`quill sns stake-maturity`].

If `<TO>` is unset, it will default to the caller; if `<PERCENTAGE>` is unset, it will default to 100%.

As this is an update call, it will not actually make the request, but rather generate a signed and packaged request that can be sent from anywhere. You can use the `--qr` flag to display it as a QR code, or if you are not working with an air-gapped machine, you can pipe it to `quill send`.
