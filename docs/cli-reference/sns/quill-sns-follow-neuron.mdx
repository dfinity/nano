# quill sns follow-neuron

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Reference"]} />

Configures a neuron to follow another neuron or group of neurons.

## Basic usage

The basic syntax for running `quill sns follow-neuron` commands is:

```bash
quill sns follow-neuron <NEURON_ID> <--type <TYPE>|--function-id <FUNCTION_ID>> <--followees <FOLLOWEES>|--unfollow> [option]
```

## Arguments

| Argument      | Description              |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| `<NEURON_ID>` | The neuron to configure. |

## Flags

| Flag           | Description                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `-h`, `--help` | Displays usage information.                      |
| `--unfollow`   | Remove any followees for this proposal function. |

## Options

| Option                        | Description                                                         |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--followees <FOLLOWEES>`     | A list of neurons to follow for this proposal function              |
| `--function-id <FUNCTION_ID>` | The numeric ID of the proposal function to restrict following to    |
| `--type <TYPE>`               | The name of the built-in proposal function to restrict following to |

## Remarks

Following neurons causes your neuron to automatically vote when the majority (by voting power) of the followed neurons do.

Follow relationships are granular by the purpose of a proposal, e.g. you can follow a neuron only for votes on transferring SNS treasury funds. There are several built-in proposal functions which this command accepts by name, but new ones can be added at any time via AddGenericNervousSystemFunction proposals and those must be addressed by integer ID.

Built-in names: `all`, `motion`, `manage-nervous-system-parameters`, `upgrade-sns-controlled-canister`, `add-generic-nervous-system-function`,
`remove-generic-nervous-system-function`, `upgrade-sns-to-next-version`, `manage-sns-metadata`, `transfer-sns-treasury-funds`, `register-dapp-canisters`,`deregister-dapp-canisters`

As this is an update call, it will not actually make the request, but rather generate a signed and packaged request that can be sent from anywhere. You can use the `--qr` flag to display it as a QR code, or if you are not working with an air-gapped machine, you can pipe it to `quill send`.
