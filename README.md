## Usage

This will sign a transfer transaction and print to STDOUT:

    nano --pem-file <path> transfer <account-id> --amount <amount>

To display the signed message in human-readable form:

    nano send --dry-run <path-to-file>

`nano` could be used on an online computer to send any signed transactions:

    nano send <path-to-file>

To get the principal and the account id:

    nano --pem-file <path> public-ids

### Governance

This is how youâ€™d stake/topup a neuron:

    nano --pem-file <path> neuron-stake --amount 2.5 --name 1

Managing the neuron:

    nano --pem-file <path> neuron-manage <neuron-id> [OPERATIONS]

Currently supported operations are: `--start-dissolving`, `--stop-dissolving`, `--disburse`, `--add-hot-key`, `--remove-hot-key`.

All of the commands above will generate signed messages, which can be sent on the online machine using the `send` command from above.
