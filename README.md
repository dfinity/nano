# quill

Minimalistic ledger and governance toolkit for cold wallets.

`quill` is a toolkit for interacting with the Network Nervous System's (NNS) canisters using self-custody keys. These
keys
can be held in an air-gapped computer (a computer
that has never connected to the internet) known as a cold wallet. To support cold wallets, `quill` takes a two-phase
approach to sending query/update calls to the IC. In the first phase, `quill` is used with the various subcommands to
generate and sign messages based on user input, without needing access to the internet. In the second phase, the signed
message(s) are sent to the IC. Since this requires connection to boundary nodes via the internet, cold-wallet users will
transport the signed message(s) from the air-gapped computer (i.e. with a USB stick, or via QR code) to a computer connected to the
internet.

AUTHORS OF THIS SOFTWARE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY TYPE, WHETHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT.

## Usage

This will sign a transfer transaction and print to STDOUT:
```shell
quill transfer <account-id> --amount <amount> --pem-file <path>
```

To display the signed message in human-readable form:
```shell
quill send --dry-run <path-to-file>
```

`quill` could be used on an online computer to send any signed transaction:

```shell
quill send <path-to-file>
```

To get the principal and the account id:
```shell
quill public-ids --pem-file <path>
```

### Governance

This is how youâ€™d stake/top-up a neuron:
```shell
quill neuron-stake --amount 2.5 --name 1 --pem-file <path>
```

Managing the neuron:
```shell
quill neuron-manage <neuron-id> [OPERATIONS] --pem-file <path>
```

All the commands above will generate signed messages, which can be sent on the online machine using the `send` command
from above.

## Download & Install

Use pre-built binaries from the latest [release](https://github.com/dfinity/quill/releases).

### MacOS (Intel Chip & Apple Silicon)

#### Install quill
1. Download the file named `quill-macos-x86_64`
2. Move the file to your `/usr/local/bin` directory to make it available system-wide

```shell
sudo mv quill-macos-x86_64 /usr/local/bin/quill
```

3. Make the file executable

```shell
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/quill
```

4. Run quill

```shell
quill -h
```

### Linux

1. Download the file specific to your system architecture
    1. for x86 download `quill-linux-x86_64`
    2. for arm32 download `quill-arm_32`
    3. for Alpine download `quill-linux-x86_64-musl`

2. Move the file to your `/usr/local/bin` directory to make it available system-wide

```shell
sudo mv quill-linux-x86_64 /usr/local/bin/quill
```

3. Make the file executable

```shell
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/quill 
```

4. Run quill

```shell
quill -h
```

### Windows

1. Download the file named `quill-windows-x86_64.exe`

2. Move it and a shell to a convenient location, e.g.

```ps1
move-item quill-windows-x86_64.exe ~\quill.exe
set-location ~
```

3. Run quill

```ps1
.\quill.exe -h
```

## Build

To compile `quill` run:

```sh
cargo build --release --locked
```

After this, find the binary at `target/release/quill`.

Quill has two optional features, all activated by default:

- `hsm`, to enable PKCS#11 HSM support (requires runtime dynamic linking)
- `ledger`, to enable Ledger Nano support (requires runtime dynamic linking, and incompatible with armv6)

To build a version of Quill compatible with statically-linked-only environments, such as Alpine, run:

```sh
cargo build --release --locked --no-default-features
```

### Building with Docker/Podman

Quill can be reproducibly built or cross-compiled in a Docker container using [`cross`](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross).

1. Follow the instructions at [cross-rs/cross](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross) to install `cross`.
2. If using a target with particular restrictions, such as `x86_64-apple-darwin` or `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, ensure you have built a local image via the instructions at [cross-rs/cross-toolchains](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross-toolchains).
3. Run `cross build --release --locked --target <target platform>`, e.g. `--target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` or `--target armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf`.

## Testnets

If you have access to an Internet Computer testnet (for example, a version the
replica binary and NNS running locally), you can target quill at this test
network by setting the `IC_URL` environment variable to the full URL. In addition
to that, it is required to use the `--insecure-local-dev-mode` flag. For
example:
```shell
IC_URL=https://nnsdapp.dfinity.network quill --insecure-local-dev-mode --pem-file <path> list-neurons
```
